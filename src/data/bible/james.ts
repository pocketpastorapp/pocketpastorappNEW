            "Consider it all joy, my brothers and sisters, when you encounter various trials,",
            "knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.",
            "And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.",
            "But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.",
            "But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.",
            "For that person ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,",
            "being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.",
            "Now the brother or sister of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;",
            "but the rich person is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away.",
            "For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich person, in the midst of his pursuits, will die out.",
            "Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.",
            "No one is to say when he is tempted, \u201cI am being tempted by God\u201d; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.",
            "But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.",
            "Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death.",
            "Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers and sisters.",
            "Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.",
            "In the exercise of His will He gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.",
            "You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;",
            "for a man\u2019s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.",
            "Therefore, ridding yourselves of all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.",
            "But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves.",
            "For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;",
            "for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.",
            "But one who has looked intently at the perfect law, the law of freedom, and has continued in it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an active doer, this person will be blessed in what he does.",
            "If anyone thinks himself to be religious, yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this person\u2019s religion is worthless.",
            "Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."

            "My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism.",
            "For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and is dressed in bright clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in,",
            "and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the bright clothes, and say, \u201cYou sit here in a good place,\u201d and you say to the poor man, \u201cYou stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,\u201d",
            "have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?",
            "Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: did God not choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?",
            "But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?",
            "Do they not blaspheme the good name by which you have been called?",
            "If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, \u201cYOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF,\u201d you are doing well.",
            "But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as violators.",
            "For whoever keeps the whole Law, yet stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all.",
            "For He who said, \u201cDO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,\u201d also said, \u201cDO NOT MURDER.\u201d Now if you do not commit adultery, but do murder, you have become a violator of the Law.",
            "So speak, and so act, as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.",
            "For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.",
            "What use is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works? Can that faith save him?",
            "If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,",
            "and one of you says to them, \u201cGo in peace, be warmed and be filled,\u201d yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?",
            "In the same way, faith also, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.",
            "But someone may well say, \u201cYou have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\u201d",
            "You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.",
            "But are you willing to acknowledge, you foolish person, that faith without works is useless?",
            "Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?",
            "You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;",
            "and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \u201cAND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,\u201d and he was called a friend of God.",
            "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.",
            "In the same way, was Rahab the prostitute not justified by works also when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?",
            "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."

            "Do not become teachers in large numbers, my brothers, since you know that we who are teachers will incur a stricter judgment.",
            "For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to rein in the whole body as well.",
            "Now if we put the bits into the horses\u2019 mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their whole body as well.",
            "Look at the ships too: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are nevertheless directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot determines.",
            "So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things.\nSee how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!",
            "And the tongue is a fire, the very world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our body\u2019s parts as that which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.",
            "For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.",
            "But no one among mankind can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.",
            "With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people, who have been made in the likeness of God;",
            "from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, these things should not be this way.",
            "Does a spring send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?",
            "Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, bear olives, or a vine bear figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh.",
            "Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.",
            "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth.",
            "This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.",
            "For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.",
            "But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, free of hypocrisy.",
            "And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."

            "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is the source not your pleasures that wage war in your body\u2019s parts?",
            "You lust and do not have, so you commit murder. And you are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.",
            "You ask and do not receive, because you ask with the wrong motives, so that you may spend what you request on your pleasures.",
            "You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.",

            "But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, \u201cGOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.\u201d",

            "Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.",
            "Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters. The one who speaks against a brother or sister, or judges his brother or sister, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.",
            "There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you, judging your neighbor?",
            "Come now, you who say, \u201cToday or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.\u201d",
            "Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. For you are just a vapor that appears for a little while, and then vanishes away.",
