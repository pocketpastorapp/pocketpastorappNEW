            "Then David went up in accordance with the word of Gad, just as the LORD had commanded.",
            "And Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; so Araunah went out and bowed his face to the ground before the king.",
            "Then Araunah said, \u201cWhy has my lord the king come to his servant?\u201d And David said, \u201cTo buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.\u201d",
            "Araunah then said to David, \u201cLet my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his sight. Look, here are the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.",
            "\u201cEverything, O king, Araunah gives to the king.\u201d And Araunah said to the king, \u201cMay the LORD your God be favorable to you.\u201d",
            "However, the king said to Araunah, \u201cNo, but I will certainly buy it from you for a price; for I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing.\u201d So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.",
            "Then David built there an altar to the LORD, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the LORD responded to prayer for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel."
