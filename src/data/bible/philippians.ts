            "For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work among you will complete it by the day of Christ Jesus.",
            "For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.",
            "For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.",

            "the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking that they are causing me distress in my imprisonment.",
            "What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice.\nBut not only that, I also will rejoice,",
            "for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,",

            "holding firmly the word of life, so that on the day of Christ I can take pride because I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.",
